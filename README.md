# open-plan living room project in blender
I designed an open-plan living room for the design project required for my Computer Engineering Department's Design and Animation course (code BLM2-4731), using Blender for the scene design.
---
How did you meet the project requirements?
- Main geometric structures: All structures in the project were created from scratch; I only prepared an archive of image files for reference purposes, and based on the structures in this archive, I made similar and identical ones.
- Shading: I made changes to the color parameter in the Diffuse BSDF section of the textures' shading; in the material output section, I used the BSDF with the Surface.
- Other structures used in the project: In order to be realistic, I used Bezier Circle and Bezier Curve, which are mathematically calculated smooth geometric curves and circles, with their measurements being automatically optimized. In addition to these structures, I used cube, cylinder, and plane, sphere; to add variety, I used surface to make the backrests of the chairs in front of the kitchen counter, and I used cube to make the backrests of the chairs in front of the door; I used Torus in the spot light sockets; for lighting, I preferred Spot light; I defined spot light with different powers in different places and used it with shadowing support; I made the curtains at the beginning of the room with texture on plane.
- Field depth: I tried to create a field depth that focuses on the Sphere.001 object on the table at the beginning of the room, following a perspective approach; I implemented the relevant camera properties under the field depth roof.
